# Astralis-Space-Mission-Planner-Exploration-Simulator
  Astralis is an in-progress project focused on developing an advanced application for simulating and optimizing Mars   
exploration missions. By integrating machine learning, terrain modeling, and space weather prediction, this project aims to guide rover navigation, predict exoplanet habitability, and track celestial objects for future space missions.

# Key Features (In Development):
  ~ Mars Terrain Simulation : 
      Generating 3D models of Mars' surface using Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) for realistic terrain visualization.
      
  ~ Hazard Detection & Navigation :
      Developing algorithms for detecting hazards (e.g., craters, rocks) and enabling adaptive rover navigation for safe   
      exploration.
      
  ~ Exoplanet Habitability Prediction :
      Implementing machine learning models to predict the habitability of exoplanets based on environmental factors.
      
  ~ Space Weather Prediction :
      Modeling solar activity and predicting its potential impact on mission safety.

  ~ Space Object Tracker :
      Visualizing and simulating the real-time positions of celestial bodies (planets, asteroids, satellites).


# Technologies in Use (at the moment)
  ~ Programming Languages : Python, JavaScript
  
  ~ Libraries and Frameworks : Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Plotly, Cesium.js, Three.js, OpenCV
  
  ~ Data Sources : NASA Exoplanet Archive, NOAA/GOESS, Digital Elevation Models


# Project Goal(s):
  The goal of Astralis is to provide a suite of tools for space exploration that will enable more efficient mission planning, improve rover navigation, and deliver dynamic visualizations to support future space missions.
